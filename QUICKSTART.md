# Getting started
## Running the example
The example.sh script included here builds and launches example servers as well as a diffy instance. Verify
that the following ports are available (9000, 9100, 9200, 8880, 8881, & 8888) and run `./example/run.sh start`.

Once your local Diffy instance is deployed, you send it a few requests by running `./example/traffic.sh`.

You can now go to your browser at
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to see what the differences across our example instances look like.

## Digging deeper
That was cool but now you want to compare old and new versions of your own service. Hereâ€™s how you can
start using Diffy to compare three instances of your service:

1. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9990`. This is your primary.
2. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9991`. This is your secondary.
3. Deploy your new code to `localhost:9992`. This is your candidate.
4. Download the latest Diffy binary from maven central or build your own from the code using `./sbt assembly`.
5. Run the Diffy jar with following command line arguments:

    ```
    java -jar diffy-server.jar \
    -candidate=localhost:9992 \
    -master.primary=localhost:9990 \
    -master.secondary=localhost:9991 \
    -service.protocol=http \
    -serviceName=Fancy-Service \
    -proxy.port=:8880 \
    -admin.port=:8881 \
    -http.port=:8888 \
    -rootUrl="localhost:8888" \
    -summary.email="info@diffy.ai" \
    -summary.delay="5"
    ```

6. Send a few test requests to your Diffy instance on its proxy port:

    ```
    curl localhost:8880/your/application/route?with=queryparams
    ```

7. Watch the differences show up in your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

8. Note that after ```summary.delay``` minutes, your Diffy instance will email a summary report to your ```summary.email``` address.

*NOTE*: By default the names of the resources in the UI are fetched from the `Canonical-Resource` header in each
request. However this can be configured at boot with a static line, example: 
```
-resource.mapping='/foo/:param;f,/b/*;b,/ab/*/g;g,/z/*/x/*/p;p' \
```
In the snippet above the configuration form is: `<pattern>;<resource-name>[,<pattern>;<resource-name>]*`

The first matching configuration will be found

## Using Diffy with Docker

You can pull the [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/diffy/diffy/) with `docker pull diffy/diffy`

And run it with
```
docker run -d --name diffy-01 \
  -p 8880:8880 -p 8881:8881 -p 8888:8888 \
  diffy/diffy \
    -candidate=localhost:9992 \
    -master.primary=localhost:9990 \
    -master.secondary=localhost:9991 \
    -service.protocol=http \
    -serviceName="Tier-Service" \
    -proxy.port=:8880 \
    -admin.port=:8881 \
    -http.port=:8888 \
    -rootUrl=localhost:8888 \
    -summary.email="docker@diffy.ai" \
    -summary.delay="5"
```

You should now be able to point to:
 - http://localhost:8888 to see the web interface
 - http://localhost:8881/admin for admin console
 - Use port 8880 to make the API requests

*NOTE*: You can  pull the [sample service](https://hub.docker.com/r/diffy/example-service/) and deploy the `production` (primary, secondary) and `candidate` tags to start playing with diffy right away.

You can always build the image from source with `docker build -t diffy .`


## FAQ's
   For safety reasons `POST`, `PUT`, ` DELETE ` are ignored by default . Add ` -allowHttpSideEffects=true ` to your command line arguments to enable these verbs.

## HTTPS
If you are trying to run Diffy over a HTTPS API, the config required is:

    -service.protocol=https

And in case of the HTTPS port be different than 443:

    -https.port=123
